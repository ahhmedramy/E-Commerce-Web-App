# E-Commerce Web App (Bash-Driven Deployment)

This repository contains **both** the source code of a training e-commerce web application and the **Bash deployment script** used in the KodeKloud Bash-Scripting course (DevSecOps track).

The project simulates a real-world scenario where a Security/DevOps engineer automates the provisioning of the full stack: firewall, database, web server, application code, and validation.  
It is intended for **advanced** learners who want to integrate Bash scripting with DevSecOps and SOC workflows.
